📊 Sales Analysis Dashboard – Turning Data into Decisions 🚀
This is the Sales Analysis Dashboard I created to break down sales performance into key focus areas, making insights easy to explore and act on. The dashboard is structured into multiple pages, each addressing a crucial aspect of sales data:

🔍 Key Dashboard Pages:

✅ Sales Overview Dashboard – Provides a high-level summary of total sales, revenue trends, and key performance metrics.

✅ Product Performance Dashboard – Analyzes product-wise sales trends, identifying best-sellers and underperforming items.

✅ Geographical Sales Insights – Maps sales distribution across regions, helping businesses pinpoint strong and weak markets.

✅ Salesperson Performance Dashboard – Evaluates team and individual performance, tracking contributions and sales impact.

This dashboard makes it easy to explore sales trends, spot opportunities, and make better business decisions at a glance.
